#About this project
</h1>

A laravel project that was created by me, which has to do with calling data from the database of a Polish company, where the data is displayed based on tables and functions created that return specific results related to various reports of the company.



This project is part of the work in previous companies.

This includes some tables from (non-local) databases that are utilized by the company's employees, as it produces the results of reports that are registered by the employees themselves in Poland.

This project also concerns the payments of the company to the assets of other companies, where each company is registered.

The idea was to display data, payments, debts and other information related to other companies, but of course for security reasons the data will not be displayed.
