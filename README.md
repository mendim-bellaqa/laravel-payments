#About this project
</h1>

I created a Laravel project that involves retrieving data from a Polish company's database. The retrieved data is then displayed using tables and functions specifically designed to produce results related to the company's various reports. This project was completed as part of my previous work experience.

The project also involves accessing tables from non-local databases used by the company's employees to generate report results registered by the employees themselves in Poland. Additionally, it deals with the payments the company makes to assets owned by other registered companies.

The goal was to display data, payments, debts, and other information related to the other companies. However, due to security concerns, the data will not be visible.
